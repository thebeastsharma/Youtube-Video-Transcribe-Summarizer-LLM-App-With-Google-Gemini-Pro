# Youtube-Video-Transcribe-Summarizer-LLM-App-With-Google-Gemini-Pro
Welcome to the YouTube Video Summarizer project! This application leverages the Gemini API to automatically generate concise summaries of YouTube video content. Whether you're a student, researcher, or just a curious individual, this tool helps you quickly grasp the main points of any video.
Overview
The YouTube Video Summarizer uses the Gemini API to analyze YouTube videos and produce brief summaries. This is especially useful for quickly understanding the key concepts and discussions presented in a video without having to watch the entire content.

How It Works
1) YouTube Video URL Input: Enter the URL of the YouTube video you want to summarize.
2) Content Extraction: The application fetches the video content using YouTube's API.
3) Summarization: The Gemini API processes the extracted content and generates a summary.
4) Display Summary: The summarized text is then presented to the user.
